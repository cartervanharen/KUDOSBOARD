### Reflection

We didn't really do labs this week, we breifly looked at them and then was given work time for the project. Mostly relied on google.
Add your response here

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I think I could have make my comment functions better, they are ineffeicent and not well layed out.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

We didn't demo this week. They said we will demo sometime next week.
